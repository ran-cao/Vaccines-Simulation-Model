study how the change of vaccine release date and change of vaccine efficacy rate bring variation of cost and benefit

In 2009, an H1N1 pandemic hit 306.8 million people in the U.S. and caused approximately 60.8 million people to get sick, hospitalized 274,304, and killed 12,496. H1N1 hit in two waves: an outbreak in July followed by another larger outbreak in December. Because this flu was new, no previous protection worked. Vaccines were produced a few months after the first outbreak. After the H1N1 vaccines were used, the H1N1 morbidity and mortality rate successfully declined. However, not everyone who got vaccinated could become immune. Only a part of the population can get immune, because vaccines work differently: for some people, they are naturally unresponsive to the vaccine while for others, antibodies take a while to develop in the body system after vaccination. During this developing time, the vaccinated population still has the possibility to get infected by others. Producing vaccines is time consuming, and the vaccine released date affects the population. The expedition of vaccine production can increase or lower the morbidity and mortality, also generating economic cost or benefit.

#### In this project, for studying H1N1 influenza, we aim to study how the change of vaccine release date and change of vaccine efficacy rate bring variation of cost and benefit, based on the equations and mathematical models we come up with.
